# Enhancing-Graph-Algorithms-for-Finding-Longest-and-Shortest-Paths-in-Networks
Enhancing graph algorithms to find both shortest and longest paths between nodes. This Python project uses Dijkstra's algorithm and its modified version for pathfinding, with visualization through NetworkX and Matplotlib. It compares algorithm efficiency and provides a user-friendly interface for graph input.
